\subsection*{Project Overview}

2D discrete path planners are designed for the navigation of a holonomic robot in a known static and flat environment. All the planners share the same common interface and should implement the ​search​ method that has the following signature\+: search(world\+\_\+state, robot\+\_\+pose, goal\+\_\+pose) return path

Inputs\+: world\+\_\+state is a 2D-\/grid representation of the environment where the value 0 indicates a navigable space and the value 1 indicates an occupied/obstacle space.

robot\+\_\+pose is a tuple of two indices (x, y) which represent the current pose of the robot in world\+\_\+state​.

goal\+\_\+pose​ ​is a tuple of two indices (x, y) which represent the goal in ​world\+\_\+state coordinate system.

\mbox{\hyperlink{classOutput}{Output}}\+: path is a list of tuple (x, y) representing a path from the ​robot\+\_\+pose to the goal\+\_\+pose​ in world\+\_\+state​ or​ None​ if no path has been found.

Two discrete planners are implemented\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Random Planner The random planner tries to find a path to the goal by randomly moving in the environment (only orthogonal moves are legal). If the planner can not find an acceptable solution in less than max\+\_\+step\+\_\+number, the search should fail. The random planner, while being erratic, has a short memory, and it will never attempt to visit a cell that was visited in the last ​sqrt(max\+\_\+step\+\_\+number)​ steps except if this is the only available option.
\item Optimal Planner A 2D path planner with A$\ast$ algorithm is designed and developed, for the navigation of the robot (only orthogonal moves are legal). The A$\ast$ algorithm ensures optimality of the path, with obstacle avoidance defined in the world.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Comparison of planners\+:

The performance of these two planners is compared on basis of search space explored, time taken to find a path, and optimality of the path found. Random planner was run 10 times and optimal planner once. The optimal planner is able to find a solution within 26 steps counting the start pose. To compare the results with random planner, the value of max\+\_\+step\+\_\+number is set to 26. The results are summarized in the following table.

 

From the results we can conclude that, the random planner finds a solution, 60\% of the time, when the max\+\_\+step\+\_\+size is equal to the nodes explored by the optimal planner. If, the random planner is able to find a path, it performs better in terms of search space explored, which is 63.\+2\% on an average, whereas, the optimal planner explores 89.\+6\% of the available space. Considering the complexity or optimality of solution, optimal planner performs better as the optimality is gauranteed by the heuristic function. The solution provided by random planner costs almost double to reach the goal node. In applications, where finding a feasible solution is considered more important than optimal solution, random planner can be used, as it is able to provide solution in $\sim$66\% less time compared to optimal planner. Considered that, the random planner is unable to find a path in first attempt, re-\/running the random planner is time efficient than running optimal planner once.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

The path planning module has following dependencies\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item googletest
\item cmake
\item gnuplot
\item \href{http://stahlke.org/dan/gnuplot-iostream/}\texttt{ gnuplot-\/iostream}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\#\# Standard install via command-\/line 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone --recursive https://github.com/ajeetwankhede/Discrete-planner-for-motion-planning}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <path to repository>}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{Run tests: ./test/cpp-test}
\DoxyCodeLine{Run program: ./app/shell-app}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Run a demo}

After running the steps for standard install via comman-\/line, run the program. The program asks whether the user wants to run a demo. Type \textquotesingle{}m\textquotesingle{} for a demo and then select any planner. The demo example should generate following figures.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Random planner demo\+:

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Optimal planner demo\+:

\subsection*{Building for code coverage}

The code coverage of the functions is 82.\+1\% and to get a .html output run the following commands. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-get install lcov}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <path to repository>}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ../}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{make code\_coverage}
\end{DoxyCode}
 This generates a index.\+html page in the build/coverage sub-\/directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser. Screenshot of the .html file is shown below.

 

\subsection*{How to generate Doxygen report}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-get install doxygen}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd <path to repository>}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir Doxygen}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd Doxygen}
\DoxyCodeLine{doxygen -g <config\_file\_name>}
\DoxyCodeLine{gedit <config\_file\_name>}
\end{DoxyCode}
 Update P\+R\+O\+J\+E\+C\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME and I\+N\+P\+UT fields in the configuration file. Then run the following command to generate the documentations. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{doxygen <config\_file\_name>}
\end{DoxyCode}
 In Doxygen folder, config file and genertaed reports are saved as html and latex format in Doxygen directory.

\subsection*{Tools for static code analysis}

Cpplint is used for static code analysis to identify potential source code issues that conflict with the Google C++ style guide. Further, cppcheck is used to detect various kinds of bugs in the code. The results generated by these tools are kept in results directory

\subsection*{Dynamic analysis tool}

Valgrind is used to automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile the programs in detail. The valgrind output showing that there is no memory leak in this code is in results folder. The memory profiler output is shown below.
